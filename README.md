### Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included to help you easily test all API endpoints.  
See the file: **`HotelListing Local.postman_collection.json`**

**Notes:**
- The collection uses a global variable `{{localhost}}` in all request URLs.  
  By default, it points to: `http://localhost:5103`  
- If you are running the API on a different port, simply update the value of the global variable to match your setup.
